            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>A Copy of a Paper delivered to the Commiſſioners of Parliament, from the Generall and Councell of Warre.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>My Lords and Gentlemen,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WE received this incloſed paper the laſt night from the hands of a very well affected Citizen: It was delivered him by an Officer of the Citie Militia, who being invited to meet ſome Citizens at <hi>Skinners Hall,</hi> upon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> laſt, with divers others, to ſigne the ſame; and offering to diſpute the matter of it to them how dangerous and illegall it was; was ſilenced, and told that it was not to be diſputed, but to be ſigned and joyned in, there being divers Citizens and others at the ſame place for that purpoſe, which when he underſtood he took this printed Copie away with him.</p>
               <p>By the contents of which, when you read it, you will eaſily perceive what it tends to, and how deſperate and dangerous it is, to the hazard of the whole Kingdome, and to fruſtrat all thoſe endevours of the Parliament, the Army, and Kingdom, for an happy ſettlement. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to precipitate all into a new and bloody warre. We cannot therefore but acquaint you, that we look at this,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114380:4"/>as a buſineſſe ſet on foot by the malice of ſome deſperate minded men, this being their laſt engine for the putting all into confuſion, when they could not accompliſh their wicked ends by other meanes.</p>
               <p>To this have all ſecret liſtings tended, and we wiſh that needleſſe and ſuperfluous liſting of Auxiliaries, and connivance at the continuance of the Reformados about the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> have not had the ſame aime. And by this we hope it will appeare, that our jealouſies and feares of ſome ſuch deſperate deſigne to be hatched in and about the Citie, conſidering the ſenſe of men there, have not been groundleſſe, nor our deſires to draw neere the Citie of <hi>London</hi> with the Army, to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point and break all ſuch plots, and to free the Parliament from violence of them, have not been without juſt cauſe; and we deſire all indifferent men to judge, whether our withdrawing from the Citie in obedience to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments commands, was for theirs and the Kingdomes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, or not. We wonder that divers men did calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate at our marching ſo neer the Citie, and put ſo bad repreſentations upon it, as that it tended to force the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or to plunder the Citie, ſeeing our doing ſo, was to break the black deſigne which now begins to ſhew it ſelfe in its colours: whereas indeed our conſciences wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with us that our Armies were cleare and honeſt, tending to reſtore the Parliament unto its juſt liberty, which was much abated in the eyes of all the kingdome, and no doubt by the authors and contrivers of this new covenant and engagement, ſome whereof have been ſo farre from aſſiſting to put the Reformados, and other dangerous perſons out of the lines, that now they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in to joyne in this conſpiracy.</p>
               <p>We entreate you to give the Parliament a full repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, of theſe things, which that you may do we
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114380:4"/>have ſent you the Papers, together with ſuch informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as may give them an opportunity to diſcover the bottome of this buſineſſe. We were marching from <hi>London</hi> (when we received this information) in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Parliament, to give the City content, and to ſtop the mouthes of ſlanderers. But if ſuch deſignes ſo deſtructive to the Parliament, and the worke in hand be ſuffered to goe on, or that the Parliament be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in the freedome of their debates, and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as we heare within theſe few days they were, by thoſe that are invited to partake of this confederacy.</p>
               <p>Wee beg it of the Parliament, as they tender their owne ſafety the peace of the Kingdome, and preventing of a ſecond Warre, as they would not have the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, loſe the fruite and benifit of all the blood and treaſure that hath beene ſpent in this Cauſe, that they would not ſuffer their freedome and Liberty to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered by ſuch deſignes as theſe, they having an Army, which by the bleſſing of God in ſpight of all that theirs, and the Kingdomes enemies can doe, will ſtand and fall with them, and be firme, faithfull, and obedient to them in all things, and as ready to releive <hi>Ireland</hi> when the peace and Rights of the Kingdom are ſetled.</p>
               <p>Wee write not this to deſire the Parliament to invite us to march up to them, wee care not how great a diſtance wee are from <hi>London,</hi> if it bee the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments pleaſure, and conſiſts with their ſecurity, and the breaking off thoſe combinations which are hatched in the bowels of that Citie.</p>
               <p>We are haſtening out Propoſals which are for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſettlement, and which we are conſident will ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all that love truth and peace.</p>
               <p>But we ſee plainly, we need more to intend ſecurity, then have cauſe to expect to bring things to a happy iſſue
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114380:5"/>by treaty, while ſuch deſignes are on foot We pray you therefore that the Parliament would ſpeedily &amp; through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enquire into, and break theſe deſignes, wherein as in all things elſe we ſhall be ready to ſerve them, as they ſhall judge it needfull; and when they ſhall command us.</p>
